REMEMBER THE CAT
================

This is a public repository from my "remember the milk" website. And because I'm a big fan of open source I made my code public!

*I want to warn you! This is some crappy code! I want to refactor it as soon as possible... But it will be hard!*

Let's begin
-----------

- change a config.yml file in the config directory

Config.yml
----------

Should look like this:

    development:
        fousa: <your-server-url>
        rememberthemilk:
            api_key: <your-api-key>
            secret: <your-api-secret>
